solvation.

Variant 1) Solvate with Q. Do an equlibration, create a new pdb from the end, and resolvate. Repeat.
Variant 2) Delete all water after equilibration and re solvate. Same number of water added?

Expected: No water is added.
Actual behaviour: Water is added at least in protein run. (20A with mixed water/protein boundary).

Rationalizing:  Probably some water is moving into the restricted boundary and sticks there (same with protein),
                so a water fits in. 
                Would be interesting to see if same happens with Gromacs.
