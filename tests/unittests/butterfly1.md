#Generate two topologies, and change a very small thing in one of the two 
(for example rotate a random water by 45 degrees). run the two simulations and compare.

predicted outcome: energy should be the same after equlibration, but temperature, energy etc
during the course of the simulation should vary at start a little bit, and this should have impact on end of sim.
may be it is needed to print more significant digits of temperature.

enhanced effect: vdw clash 2 water molecules.
